# UCLAND APIs

This is the generated documentation for the UCLAND source code which describes the APIs as well as some features of the code.

This documentation is also available as web-linkable pages hosted on [read the docs](http://ucland.readthedocs.io/), where the pages are generated with sphinx.

If you are looking for a user guide, start at the [UCLAND-examples wiki](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/UCLAND-examples/wiki) which has installation instructions, links to tutorials, and more.

The APIs in UCLAND are documented using doxygen - you are viewing the result. A brief style guide for using doxygen in UCLAND is available at https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/UCLAND/wiki/Doxygen.
